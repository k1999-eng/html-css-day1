    <h1> FRUITS</h1>
    <p>
        Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids. Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk
        of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes.

        Possibly the most ubiquitous juice on the market, fresh orange juice is one of the healthiest drinks you can grab. Everybody knows it's a great source of vitamin C, but most people don't know that this healthy drink is a good source of potassium and thiamin
        plus calcium and vitamin D if it's fortified
